# yUML to SVG in the browser

Demo of [yuml2svg](//github.com/aduh95/yuml2svg).

You can run a local server with PHP or Python:

```shell
php -S localhost:8080 -t src/
python -m http.server --directory /tmp/
```

This version uses CDN hosted files, you would need access to the internet to get
it working.
